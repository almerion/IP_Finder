# Python

A very very basic Python3 Network Script that finds site's IP, pings and traceroutes.

Consider this:
If you want to tcptraceroute, you should be a superuser as root in Linux.
The script did not run yet in Windows and MacOS. 

I want to see your feedbacks/commits for my first script.

Good luck!
